# Project Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025

## Changes Made

### âœ… Phase 1: Frontend Cleanup
**Removed 5 unused page files:**
1. `frontend/src/pages/AuthPage.js` - Not imported anywhere (SimpleAuth.js is used instead)
2. `frontend/src/pages/AuthPageEnhanced.js` - Not imported anywhere
3. `frontend/src/pages/AdvancedTrade.js` - Not imported anywhere  
4. `frontend/src/pages/AdvancedTrading.js` - Not imported anywhere
5. `frontend/src/pages/MyOrders.js` - Not imported anywhere

### âœ… Phase 2: Test Files Organization
**Moved 48 test files to organized location:**
- All `*_test.py` and `check_*.py` files moved from root to `tests/archived/`
- Kept `test_result.md` in root (actively used for testing protocol)

### âœ… Phase 3: Backend Code Documentation
**Documented unused service files:**
1. `backend/admin_advanced_services.py` - Added warning comment (NOT imported in server.py)
2. `backend/admin_communication_services.py` - Added warning comment (NOT imported in server.py)
3. Commented out broken endpoint `/admin/crypto/refresh-prices` in server.py (references undefined `get_price_service`)

**Files kept but unused:**
- `backend/abantether_scraper.py` - Imported by nobitex_prices.py but not actively used
- `backend/nobitex_prices.py` - Not imported in server.py
- `backend/set_openai_key.py` - Utility script, kept for potential use

## Impact Assessment

### âœ… No Breaking Changes
- All removed files were confirmed unused (no imports found)
- Test files archived, not deleted
- Backend service files documented with warnings but kept intact
- Broken endpoint commented out (was already non-functional)

### ðŸ“Š Results
- **Files removed:** 5 frontend pages
- **Files organized:** 48 test files moved to tests/archived/
- **Files documented:** 2 backend service files + 1 endpoint commented
- **Code cleanliness:** Improved significantly without breaking functionality

## Recommendations for Future Cleanup

### Low Priority (Can be done later):
1. Review unused dependencies in `requirements.txt` and `package.json`
2. Consider removing or integrating `admin_advanced_services.py` and `admin_communication_services.py`
3. Either implement or remove `nobitex_prices.py` and `abantether_scraper.py`
4. Review console.log statements for production (currently kept for debugging)

### Notes:
- All working features remain intact
- No functional code was removed
- Test files preserved for reference
- Backend and frontend services continue to work as before
