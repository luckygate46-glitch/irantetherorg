The AI engineer's trajectory involved enhancing an Iranian crypto exchange. Initial tasks focused on fixing a persistent buy order submission issue, which involved debugging  and backend API calls, eventually confirmed working. Subsequently, the user requested AI features, leading to the implementation of an admin panel for API key management (, ). A critical security fix was performed to remove hardcoded API keys from the codebase and Git history. A user-facing AI recommendation system was added to . A missing  was created. The process then shifted to implementing API.IR integration for KYC, and later, a massive request for 40 admin AI features, for which core backend services (, , ) and a frontend  were initiated. The current focus is on debugging a critical bug where new user registrations are incorrectly resulting in admin privileges and redirection.

<product_requirements>
The application is an Iranian crypto exchange with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. It requires full user authentication (registration with phone verification for KYC, login), and a multi-level KYC system including document uploads, national ID, birthdate, banking information, admin approval, and API.IR integration. Core features include a personal wallet, card-to-card deposits, and a crypto trading system (buy/sell with manual admin confirmation). A comprehensive admin panel is essential for user, deposit, card, KYC, order management, and price overrides. The application must fully support Persian (Farsi) language and Right-to-Left (RTL) layout. Recent expansions demanded extensive AGI features for both user and admin panels, a full comprehensive upgrade with advanced trading capabilities, a KYC waiting game, and a user sidebar. More recent work included implementing robust AI features for the admin panel, an API key management menu, a Persian Smart Trading Assistant, a main landing page, and eventually all 40 suggested AI features for the admin panel.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively debugging a critical bug where new users, upon successful registration via the  page, are unexpectedly redirected to the admin panel. This suggests they are being assigned admin privileges despite the backend  model () and explicit code in  setting  during user creation.

The current debugging process began with:
1.  **Database Audit**: Verified the database is empty, ruling out existing user data corruption.
2.  **Registration Code Verification**: Re-confirmed  in 's user registration logic.
3.  **Frontend Routing Check**: Reviewed  to ensure the routing logic based on  is correct.

The investigation is now focused on understanding how the  status might be incorrectly handled or interpreted during the user object's lifecycle in the frontend after a successful login/registration, specifically within the  function in  and related components like . The objective is to identify the precise point where the  flag leads to an erroneous admin panel redirection for regular users.
