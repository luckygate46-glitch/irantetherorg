The AI engineer successfully established the core Iranian crypto exchange, covering initial user auth, admin panel, and Persian language support. Significant effort was put into implementing a trading system (buy/sell orders, admin approval), refactoring registration to collect more user details and making phone verification part of KYC. The persistent  AI issues were resolved, alongside adding performance features like rate limiting and caching. Crucially, KYC approval flow and its frontend display were fixed, ensuring user status updates correctly. Most recently, extensive AGI features for both admin and user panels were requested. A full project backup was created, and the system is ready for the systematic implementation of these AGI enhancements, focusing on core trading services.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an Iranian crypto exchange with React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. It needs user registration (first/last name, email, phone, password; phone verification moved to KYC), user login, comprehensive KYC (document upload, national ID, birthday, banking, admin approval, API.IR integration), a personal wallet, card-to-card deposits, crypto buying/selling (user order, admin manual confirmation), and broker-like crypto trading. A full admin panel for users, deposits, cards, KYC, and trading orders is essential. The application must support Farsi and RTL. Future plans include smart algorithm/engine, signal bots, Amazon ordering (via iranicard.ir), and extensive AGI features for both admin and user panels, including admin-updatable crypto prices.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed creating a comprehensive backup of the entire project. This was done in preparation for implementing an extensive set of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) features for both the user and admin panels, as explicitly requested by the user. This includes advanced functionalities like AI-powered security, analytics, user management, and more, for the admin, and intelligent personal assistants, predictive analytics, and personalized trading for users. New backend files () and frontend pages (, , , ) have been created, and related routes/navigation updated. A frontend compilation error ( icon) was fixed. Frontend login issues for admin are still present, although backend authentication is fully functional. The backend has been restarted to apply changes.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Proceed with the systematic implementation of the comprehensive AGI features for the user panel and admin panel.
