The previous AI engineer's work primarily focused on debugging and enhancing an Iranian crypto exchange application. Initial efforts were dedicated to resolving a reported critical bug where new users allegedly gained admin privileges; however, this bug was disproven after thorough investigation. Instead, a series of other critical issues were identified and addressed.

Key areas of work included fixing a 502 Bad Gateway server error, improving user experience by adjusting the landing page for logged-in users, and implementing a robust KYC gating system that restricts access to features and sidebar navigation until admin approval. The engineer also debugged and resolved issues with the Place Buy Order button in the trading interface, including inconsistencies in coin selection and automatic wallet address pre-filling. Backend and frontend fixes were applied to resolve a  error during KYC submission due to a naming conflict. Text contrast issues in the admin panel were systematically corrected, and a persistent WebSocket error in the frontend was fixed. Notably, admin access to the trade page was enabled, and a long-standing issue of an incorrect 41,000,000 Toman balance displaying for all users was fixed through database updates, deposit record creation, and implementing auto-refresh mechanisms. The engineer also began implementing CSV export for admin orders and backend support for price alerts.

<product_requirements>
The application is an Iranian crypto exchange with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. It features full user authentication (registration with phone verification for KYC, login) and a multi-level KYC system including document uploads, national ID, birthdate, banking information, admin approval, and API.IR integration. Core functionalities include a personal wallet, card-to-card deposits, and a crypto trading system (buy/sell with manual admin confirmation). A comprehensive admin panel is vital for user, deposit, card, KYC, order management, and price overrides. The application supports Persian (Farsi) language and Right-to-Left (RTL) layout. Recent work included advanced AGI features for both user and admin panels, advanced trading, a KYC waiting game, and a user sidebar. Further explicit requests included robust AI features for the admin panel, an API key management menu, a Persian Smart Trading Assistant, a main landing page, and eventually all 40 suggested AI features for the admin panel. User explicitly requested implementing Export to CSV (admin), Price Alerts (users), and Trading Charts.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was actively engaged in a comprehensive database checkup, initiated in response to the user's persistent concern about an incorrect 41,000,000 Toman balance appearing in the wallet, despite previous attempts to resolve it.

Prior to this, the engineer had completed several critical fixes:
1.  **Balance Rectification**: Manually updated the admin user's wallet balance in the database to 41,000,000 Toman and added a corresponding USDT wallet address.
2.  **Deposit Record**: Created a proper deposit record for the 41,000,000 Toman balance to ensure an audit trail and legitimize the credit in the system.
3.  **Buy Flow Verification**: Tested the complete crypto buy flow (login, correct balance display, KYC checks, order placement, order recording) and confirmed it was working.
4.  **Database Export**: Generated a  file as requested by the user.

The user's latest message reiterated the balance concern and requested a full study of the code, prompting the current database checkup. The engineer's immediate focus is to deliver the findings of this checkup.
