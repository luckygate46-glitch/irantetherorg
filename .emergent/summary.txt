The previous AI engineer's work centered on stabilizing and enhancing an Iranian crypto exchange application. Initially, a critical bug regarding new users gaining admin privileges was disproven. Instead, the focus shifted to resolving several key issues: a 502 Bad Gateway error, improving the landing page UX, implementing a robust KYC gating system, and fixing the Place Buy Order button in the trading interface. Backend and frontend fixes addressed a  error during KYC. Text contrast in the admin panel and a persistent WebSocket error were also resolved. Admin access to the trade page was enabled, and an incorrect 41M Toman balance issue was fixed through database updates and auto-refresh. The engineer began CSV export for admin orders and backend support for price alerts.

The trajectory then details the current AI engineer's work, which started with fixing a database balance issue, simplifying the wallet address input in the trade form, implementing a comprehensive in-app notification system (including a bell icon and toast notifications), fixing a critical security flaw bypassing KYC, and resolving a  in deposit approval. The smart recommendation feature was debugged and given a mock fallback. The last significant task was replacing the basic order confirmation alert with a rich . The current state ends with a user request for project cleanup.

<product_requirements>
The application is an Iranian crypto exchange (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) featuring user authentication with phone verification for KYC. It includes a multi-level KYC system (document uploads, national ID, birthdate, banking, admin approval, API.IR integration). Core functionalities are personal wallets, card-to-card deposits, and a crypto trading system (buy/sell with manual admin confirmation). A vital admin panel manages users, deposits, cards, KYC, orders, and price overrides. The app supports Persian (Farsi) and RTL layout. Recent work included advanced AGI features for user/admin, advanced trading, KYC waiting game, user sidebar, and robust AI features for the admin panel, an API key management menu, a Persian Smart Trading Assistant, and a main landing page. Explicit requests included Export to CSV (admin), Price Alerts (users), and Trading Charts. Recent fixes and additions involved rectifying balance display, enabling admin access to trade pages, simplifying the wallet system, implementing a full in-app notification system with toast popups, fixing a critical KYC bypass security flaw, debugging deposit approval, and enhancing order confirmation with a modal.

<current_work>
The AI engineer successfully completed several critical tasks. The  was implemented in  to provide a more detailed and user-friendly experience after a buy order submission, replacing the previous  message. This modal now displays comprehensive order information and next steps.

Immediately prior to this summary, the user confirmed satisfaction with the overall progress, specifically mentioning successful order placement and admin approval triggering notifications. However, the user also requested a thorough cleaning of the project, focusing on both the admin panel and user sections, to ensure no working features are harmed and to optimize the codebase. This cleanup request follows a series of recent fixes, including:
- Implementing a robust in-app notification system (bell icon, toast popups) for deposit, KYC, and order approvals.
- Fixing a critical security flaw where new users bypassed KYC approval due to incorrect frontend routing.
- Resolving a  in backend deposit approval logic.
- Adding a mock/fallback for the Smart Trading Recommendation when the OpenAI API key is unavailable.
