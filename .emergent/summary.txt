The AI engineer's work trajectory involved progressively enhancing an Iranian crypto exchange. Initially, extensive AGI features for both admin and user panels were implemented, followed by a full comprehensive upgrade with new trading and AI functionalities. Significant effort was dedicated to troubleshooting persistent login/registration issues, leading to a simplified authentication page. Subsequently, user-requested features like a KYC waiting game, a comprehensive user sidebar, and a wallet management system were implemented. The engineer then focused on adding comprehensive AI-powered features to the admin panel, integrating their backend endpoints and updating the frontend. A major part of the work involved rectifying critical issues with the trading system, including fixing buy/sell logic, ensuring correct Toman price display by attempting integration with various Iranian price sources (Nobitex, Abantether, Wallex), and implementing robust caching. The final stages focused on fixing user journey issues, specifically the buy order not processing after balance deductions and wallet registration, leading to the creation of a  for future order history.

<product_requirements>
The application is an Iranian crypto exchange with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. It requires full user authentication (registration with phone verification for KYC, login), and a multi-level KYC system including document uploads, national ID, birthdate, banking information, admin approval, and API.IR integration. Core features include a personal wallet, card-to-card deposits, and a crypto trading system (buy/sell with manual admin confirmation). A comprehensive admin panel is essential for user, deposit, card, KYC, order management, and price overrides. The application must fully support Persian (Farsi) language and Right-to-Left (RTL) layout. Recent expansions demanded extensive AGI features for both user and admin panels (e.g., security, analytics, personalized trading), a full comprehensive upgrade with advanced trading capabilities (multi-asset, staking/yield farming, portfolio analysis), a KYC waiting game, and a user sidebar offering profile, wallet, banking info, currency exchange, rewards, and support features. Recent work also explicitly aimed to implement robust AI features for the admin panel and ensure accurate Toman pricing from Iranian sources. User management improvements were also explicitly requested for the  panel.

<code_architecture>

-   : Main FastAPI app.
    -   *Importance*: Centralizes backend logic and API routes.
    -   *Changes*: Integrated  endpoints for admin AI features, fixed authentication to use . Modified price fetching to use Nobitex/Abantether/Wallex logic (later reverted to static due to network issues) and updated trading order creation to use Toman prices and handle wallet addresses, including balance deduction. Added new user management endpoints (suspend, ban, notes, tags, search, bulk).
-   :
    -   *Importance*: Encapsulates comprehensive AI services for the admin panel.
    -   *Changes*: Implemented with rule-based logic for admin AI features.
-    (NEW):
    -   *Importance*: Initially intended for scraping/fetching Toman crypto prices from Nobitex.
    -   *Changes*: Created, evolved from direct scraping to API calls, and then simplified to return static prices due to container network restrictions.
-    (NEW):
    -   *Importance*: Created to specifically scrape crypto prices from Abantether.com.
    -   *Changes*: Implemented web scraping logic, but ultimately unused due to network issues and a shift to static prices.
-    (NEW):
    -   *Importance*: Created to integrate with the Wallex API for Toman crypto prices.
    -   *Changes*: Implemented API integration, but also reverted due to network restrictions and a shift to static prices.
-   : Main React router.
    -   *Importance*: Manages navigation.
    -   *Changes*: Added routes for new admin AI pages and user management improvements.
-   : User trading page.
    -   *Importance*: Handles cryptocurrency buying/selling.
    -   *Changes*: Fixed missing Authorization headers for API calls, updated price display logic to remove erroneous 50,000 multiplier, integrated wallet address input (later made optional/auto-filled from profile), and added debug logs for order submission.
-   : User market overview page.
    -   *Importance*: Displays crypto prices.
    -   *Changes*: Updated to display Toman prices, and fixed a volume is not defined error by removing the volume display section.
-   : User profile page.
    -   *Importance*: Manages user profile and wallet addresses.
    -   *Changes*: Fixed USDT wallet address validation to accept TRC20 addresses (starting with T).
-   , , , :
    -   *Importance*: Frontend pages for admin AI features.
    -   *Changes*: Updated to fetch data from the comprehensive AI backend endpoints, fixed incorrect import paths for  (from  to ), and adjusted alert rendering.
-   : Admin user management page.
    -   *Importance*: Admin interface for managing users.
    -   *Changes*: Completely revamped to include enhanced user management features (e.g., suspend, ban, notes, tags, search, bulk operations).
-    (NEW):
    -   *Importance*: Intended to display user's order history and a factor (receipt).
    -   *Changes*: Created as a placeholder, but the full implementation for redirecting and displaying order details is pending.
-   : Admin layout component.
    -   *Importance*: Provides consistent layout for admin pages.
    -   *Changes*: Confirmed its existence and correct path after import errors were identified.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement the full user order history and factor (receipt) display on  and integrate the redirection logic after order placement.
- Debug and resolve the issue where the buy order is not being fully processed or sent to the backend despite the button click being registered.
- Implement more robust real-time Toman price fetching if container network restrictions are lifted or an alternative method (e.g., user-provided API keys for a proxy) becomes available, instead of static prices.
- Incorporate advanced user roles, activity tracking, enhanced security features, and user analytics into the admin user management panel.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a critical issue where the ثبت سفارش خرید (buy order) button on the  page is not successfully submitting orders, even after previous fixes for balance validation and wallet address handling. The user reported still nothing happens when clicking the button.

Upon investigation, the engineer confirmed that the button click handler ( in ) is indeed firing, but the order data is not being sent to the backend as expected. Debugging  statements were added to  within the  and  functions to pinpoint where the execution flow halts or fails before the  call to the  endpoint.

A new file, , has been created. This file is intended to eventually display the user's order history and a factor (receipt) after an order is placed, fulfilling a user request. However, the immediate focus remains on successfully submitting the buy order to the backend, as the order history cannot be populated without successful order creation. The current state involves gathering more granular debugging information from the frontend console to diagnose the precise failure point in the order submission logic.

<optional_next_step>
Observe the console logs from the  page to pinpoint the exact failure point in the buy order submission logic after the button click is registered.
