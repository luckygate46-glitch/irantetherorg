<analysis>
The AI engineer's work focused on progressively expanding an Iranian crypto exchange. Initially, the core application, including authentication and basic admin features, was already established. The trajectory began with the implementation of extensive AGI features for both admin and user panels, followed by a full comprehensive upgrade encompassing new trading and AI functionalities.

Significant effort was dedicated to troubleshooting persistent login/registration issues, which required iterative debugging of frontend components, leading to the creation of a simplified authentication page. Subsequently, the engineer addressed user feedback regarding inaccessible features, implementing a KYC waiting game and a comprehensive user sidebar. This also involved fixing critical issues with the portfolio and trade pages, correcting KYC-based access, and implementing a wallet management system, including backend endpoints and frontend UI. Most recently, the engineer embarked on adding numerous AI-powered features to the admin panel, creating new frontend pages and a backend service. The current work halted just before integrating these new AI admin endpoints into .

<product_requirements>
The goal is an Iranian crypto exchange with React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. It requires user registration (first/last name, email, phone, password; phone verification for KYC), user login, and a multi-level KYC system with document uploads, national ID, birthdate, banking, admin approval, and API.IR integration. Features include a personal wallet, card-to-card deposits, and a crypto trading system (buy/sell with admin manual confirmation). A comprehensive admin panel is needed for user, deposit, card, KYC, order management, and price overrides. The app must support Persian (Farsi) and RTL. Recent expansions include extensive AGI features for both user and admin panels (security, analytics, personalized trading), a full comprehensive upgrade with advanced trading (multi-asset, staking/yield farming, portfolio analysis), a KYC waiting game, a user sidebar with profile, wallet, banking info, currency exchange, rewards, and support features, and robust AI features for the admin panel. Advanced authentication was explicitly excluded from the latest upgrade.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing comprehensive AI-powered features for the admin panel, as per the user's explicit request to implement them all.

On the **frontend**, four new admin-specific AI pages have been created:
-   
-   
-   
-   

The  router has been updated to include routes for all these new admin AI pages, ensuring they are accessible within the application's navigation structure.

On the **backend**, a new Python file, , has been created. This file is intended to house the backend logic and API endpoints for these new AI-driven admin functionalities.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just finished creating  and was about to proceed with adding its comprehensive AI endpoints into the main  file to make these new backend services available through the API. The frontend components for these features are currently placeholders, awaiting the completion of their backend counterparts.
